# Minishell (February 2022)
> The objective of this project is for you to create a simple shell. Yes, your little bash or zsh. You will learn a lot about processes and file descriptors.

Group project done together with [@adelcor](https://github.com/adelcor). My other 42 projects are [in a separate repository](https://github.com/nicolasgasco/42_cursus).

The shell will:
- show a prompt when waiting for a new command.
- have a working History.
- search and launch the right executable
- execute builtins (echo, cd, pwd, export, unset, env, exit)
- interpret simple and double quotes
- execute redirections (<, >, <<, >>)
- execute pipes
- expand environment variables
- ctrl-C, ctrl-D, ctrl-\
