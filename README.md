# Minishell (February 2022)
> The objective of this project is for you to create a simple shell. Yes, your little bash or zsh. You will learn a lot about processes and file descriptors.

Group project done together with [@adelcor](https://github.com/adelcor).

The shell will:
- show a prompt when waiting for a new command
- have a working history
- search and launch the right executable
- execute builtins (`echo`, `cd`, `pwd`, `export`, `unset`, `env`, `exit`)
- interpret simple and double quotes
- execute redirections (`<`, `>`, `<<`, `>>`)
- execute pipes
- expand environment variables and `$?`
- `ctrl-C`, `ctrl-D`, `ctrl-\`
