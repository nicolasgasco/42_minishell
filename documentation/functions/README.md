# Functions

The functions allowed in Minishell

- Readline:
  - [On using readline](https://web.mit.edu/gnu/doc/html/rlman_2.html)
  - **readline**: will read a line from the terminal and return it, using prompt as a prompt
  - **rl_clear_history**: Clear the history list by deleting all of the entries
  - **rl_on_new_line**: Tell the update functions that we have moved onto a new (empty) line, usually after outputting a newline
  - **rl_replace_line**: Replace the contents of rl_line_buffer with text
  - **rl_redisplay**: Change what's displayed on the screen to reflect the current contents of rl_line_buffer
  - **add_history**: If you want the user to be able to get at the line later, (with C-p for example), you must call add_history () to save the line away in a history list of such lines
- Output:
  - **printf**
  - **write**
- Memory management:
  - **malloc**
  - **free**
- Processes:
  - **access**: checks whether the calling process can access the file pathname. If pathname is a symbolic link, it is dereferenced.

  - **waitpid**
